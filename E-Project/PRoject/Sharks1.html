                tuna capture methods saved millions of the species in the eastern Pacific Ocean and it is now one of the

                triangular-shaped dorsal fin.Unlike most types of dolphins where the female is larger, long-beaked males
                are nearly 5% larger than the females.</p>

              <p class="p0">One of the most famous dolphin names you’ve probably heard is the killer whale. Like all
                dolphins, the orca is a whale.What sets it apart from other types of dolphins is that it is toothed and
                belongs to the Delphinidae family.The killer whales are the largest dolphins worldwide and can grow over
                26 feet (8 meters) long and weigh as much as 7,000 lbs. (3175 kg).Another unique fact is that killer
                whales are called “whale killer.” We can all agree that it’s easier to flip around the words and call
                the oceanic mammal a killer whale.</p>

                and they are very abundant among other stingrays of the same size.
                They are mostly found in warm waters in places such as the Caribbean Sea and the coastlines of both
                North and South America.

              <h1 class="h0">Skate Rays</h1><br>
              <p class="p0">Skates are very similar to stingrays but have a few differences. For one thing, skates have
                no stings but instead, they have sharp barbs found alongside their spines and sometimes on their tails,
                which they use for defense. Their tails are also wider than those on stingrays, and they have small fins
                near the tip of their tails.

              <h1 class="h0">Sting Rays</h1><br>
              <p class="p0"> Stingrays have long, thin tales that contain barbed nodes that sting. Not all of the
                stingrays have this feature, but most do. The toxin the tails spew out is very painful when ejected,
                although stingrays tend not to sting people or animals unless they feel threatened.
                Standard stingrays are easily identifiable and very common, and they have diamond shapes.</p>

              <h1 class="h0">Whiptale Stingrays</h1><br>
              <p class="p0">Not surprisingly, these stingrays have tails shaped like whips, and at the tips are barbs,
                which are poisonous. Most whiptails are found in saltwater environments, but many have been known to
                inhabit freshwater areas as well, including Southeast Asia. This species includes blue, rough-tail,
                pelagic, sharp-nose, mask, and porcupine stingrays.</p>

              <h1 class="h0">Stingrays</h1><br>
              <p class="p0">Stingrays usually have flat bodies and a long, thin tail, which is where the stingers are if
                they are this type of ray. When they do produce venom, it is very powerful and can do great damage.
                Most of the time, stingrays do not sting or harm people unless they feel threatened, as they usually
                only attack when they feel their lives are in danger. You can become very ill or even die if you are
                stung by a stingray, depending on the specific situation.

              <h1 class="h0">Eagel Rays</h1><br>
              <p class="p0">Although most stingrays swim close to the bottom of the ocean, eagle rays are active
                swimmers in the open ocean, and, in fact, they are known to leap in and out of the water while they
                swim. They prefer tropical temperatures and therefore are often found in the Caribbean Sea and the
                Indian Ocean.
